# Planet Scale Ultra Low Latency SDN written in Rust

This project is a planet-scale ultra-low latency Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system. It is designed to support applications such as streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Proxies, and more. The goal of this project is to provide a network infrastructure that can deliver high-quality services with minimal latency, similar to what Cloudflare achieves for their network.

## Features

* **Performance and Scalability**: The project is built with a focus on performance and scalability. It utilizes advanced techniques and technologies to ensure ultra-low latency, even at a planet-scale. This includes efficient routing algorithms, load balancing strategies, and network optimization techniques.
* **Modularity and Flexibility**: The project is designed to be highly modular and flexible, allowing it to be adapted to various use cases. It supports a wide range of applications, including but not limited to streaming, IoT, VPN, and Proxies.
* **Open Source**: The project is open-source, meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This not only encourages community involvement and collaboration but also allows users to adapt the project to their specific needs.
* **Smart-routing**: The "Smart-routing" feature employs a decentralized algorithm that operates on each node, eliminating the need for a centralized controller. This approach enhances the network's adaptability and responsiveness, ensuring efficient and high-quality service delivery. The algorithm uses a heuristic method to optimize routing based on the current network conditions like (latency, bandwidth, packet loss, hops), making it particularly effective in dynamic network environments.

## Why Rust

We chose Rust for this project due to its exceptional performance and safety features. Rust is a system programming language that guarantees thread safety without needing a garbage collector. It provides low-level control over system resources, making it ideal for system-level tasks, such as implementing a high-performance networking system.

## Applications

The project has been tested and proven to work effectively in real-world scenarios. It has been used in various applications, including but not limited to streaming, IoT. These applications have all benefited from the ultra-low latency provided by the project.

## Contributing

The project is continuously being improved and updated. We are always looking for ways to make it better, whether that's through optimizing performance, adding new features, or fixing bugs. We welcome contributions from the community and are always looking for new ideas and suggestions.
