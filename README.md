# atm0s-sdn: Global-scaled Ultra-low latency Decentralized SDN

A SAN I/O driven, open-source decentralized network infrastructure that can deliver high-quality data with minimal latency and efficient cost, similar to what Cloudflare achieves for their network.

For a deep dive into the technical aspects of network architecture, please refer to our [Smart-Routing](https://github.com/8xFF/atm0s-sdn/blob/master/docs/smart_routing.md)

## Project Status: Alpha

This project is currently in the alpha stage of development. It is actively being developed and may undergo significant changes, including changes to the API. The primary focus at this stage is to make the project stable and reliable.

We are working with some potential partners to integrate the network in real-world scenarios. If you are interested in testing the network, feel free to contact us or sending an issues.

## Features

- High availability by being fully distributed, with no central controller.
- Multi-zone support, high scalability.
- Metric based Adaptive routing: latency, bandwidth
- Network orchestration and discovery (manual mode only).
- High extendibility by using Network Service.
- Built-in features: PubSub, KeyValue ..
- Cross platform: Linux, MacOs.

### Build-in features

- [x] Router sync: automaticaly sync routing table between nodes for implementing Smart-Routing
- [x] Pubsub: Publish/Subscribe
- [x] DHT Multi-Map: Key-Value store
- [x] Node Alias: Each node can have multiple alias
- [x] Virtual Socket: Act as virtual UDP socket
- [ ] Network accelerator by eBPF redirect
- [ ] Authentication and Encryption

### Build-in services

- [x] Visualization: show network structure
- [x] Manual discovery: each node can set owner tags and interested tags. each node will trying to connect to other nodes that have the interested tags.

## Architecture

We split logic in to 2 parts: feature and service.

- Feature: is a high-level logic that can be used to build a network service. For example, PubSub, KeyValue, Virtual Socket ..
- Service: is a extendable logic that can be used to build a custom logic. Each service can use all other features to build a custom logic.

![Network Protocol](./docs/imgs/flow.excalidraw.png)

For better in testing and developing we split library to 2 parts:

- Network Protocol: implement in SANS-I/O style
- Runner: for integrating with SANS-I/O runtime

## Getting started

Project includes some example and a standalone node, which can be used to test the network.

Build from source:

```bash
cd bin
cargo build --release
```

Running first seed node as a network structure collector:

```bash
cargo run -- --collector --local-tags demo --connect-tags demo --node-id 1 --udp-port 10001 --web-addr 0.0.0.0:3000
```

Running second nodes and join to network with seed node (you need to replace with seed node IP if it running on another device):

```bash
cargo run -- --local-tags demo --connect-tags mode --seeds 1@/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/10001 --node-id 2 --udp-port 10002
```

Same with this, we can run more nodes and connect to the network. Remember change node-id and port for not conflict with other nodes.

Access to the web interface to see the network structure: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

![Network Structure](./docs/imgs/visualization.png)

You can also enable vpn feature in each node by add `--vpn` flag. After that, each node will be assigned with a private with rule: `10.33.33.{node_id % 8}`.

## Benchmarks

### Network optimizer

We run 9 nodes accross Asia, Us, Europe with Digital Ocean and some local ISP in Vietnam and test the latency between each node. The result show that the network can speed up latency by maximum 48.5% compare to normal routing.

Maximun optimized:

|      | US    | EU     | ASIA |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| US   | 0     |        |      |
| EU   | 3.40% | 0      |      |
| ASIA | 48.5% | 28.30% | 47%  |

Average optimized:

|      | US    | EU    | ASIA |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| US   | 0     |       |      |
| EU   | 0.40% | 0     |      |
| ASIA | 11.6% | 9.50% | 3%   |

We will test more in the future to get more accurate result with more cloud provider and local ISP.

### Speeds

In some fast test, it show that network node can relay around 1Gbps per core. We will test more in the future to get more accurate result.
